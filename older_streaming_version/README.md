newton-rahpson-interest-analytic
=================================

Hadoop streaming application written in Python that calculates time-weighted interest using Newton-Rahpson method.
It considers the time of year for each adjustment, both positive and negative, that were made to each account to give a more accurate year-end interest rate. This particular implementation is designed to run in Hadoop streaming. 

Build the data using <code>python data_gen.py <num_accounts></code> where num_accounts equals how many 
unique account names to reproduce in the dataset. 

Data is in the form of (account# adjustment perc_year) where
* account# = unique account identifier,
* adjustment = +/- amount to account, 
* perc_year = days left in the year divided into 1 (ex: day 100 = (365-100)/365 = .72, day 0 = (365- 0)/365 = 1).
1.0 represents the accounts starting balance for the year. 
0.0 represents the accounts year-end balance. 

To use the default shell script first upload the data to hadoop at /fake_investments/in.

Then edit HADOOP_HOME in newton_rahpson.sh and run <code>./newton_rahspon.sh</code>. The partfile output will be under <code>/fake_investments/out</code>. 

The reducer groups by unique account, sorts by time descending order and calculates the time-weighted interest rate on the account using quadratic convergence. Each account gets 25 maximum attempts to converge the difference from the previous attempt below 0.0000001 before exiting.

Times for each account are assumed to be percentages of a common year. The analytic only works on a per-year basis for now. 
1.0 represents the beginning balance (Jan 01) and 0.0 represents the end of year (Dec 31). The reducer sorts by perc_year such that the year end entry appears first to the reducer for each account, and can be used to set the initial year-end value. Right now it's hardcode to only work with the testing dataset. Thus you'll see a hardcoded magic number of 8863.03.
